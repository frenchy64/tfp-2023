With M-O-G’s tricky kind of higher-order goal stuff, you get
*dramatic* improvement. How’s that different from the local DFS that
they /were/ using? Another potential comparison axis.

## Zzz

There’s the possibility that the Zzzs are making an important impact--cf our version w/Orchid’s. One more axis for comparison.
But I suspect not. 

There’s the possibility that the delays in the cdr are a big impact. One more axis for comparison.

Also need to run tests where we shuffle the ordering of edges and nodes and left-right of the edge pairs, to kinda avoid around that.
