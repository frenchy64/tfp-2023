\begin{abstract}
  We describe how an additional language feature---namely variadic,
  \enquote{rest argument} functions---can lead to a more powerful
  kernel language. We implement disjunction and conjunction functions
  that preserve search order and that do not create superfluous
  closures. The result is a shorter and simpler overall implementation
  that is more elegant.

\section{Introduction}

microKanren~\cite{hemann2013muKanren} is a compact approach to
implementing a relational programming language. The microKanren
approach has worked out well as a tool for understanding the guts of a
relational programming language through studying its implementation.
The microKanren reimplementation separates surface syntax macros from
function definitions. In doing so, the authors hoped this separation
would simultaneously aid future would-be implementers when studying
the source code, and also that the functional core would make the
language easier to port to other functional hosts. To support both
those efforts, they also chose to program in a deliberately small and
workaday set of Scheme primitives.

This note shows how an implementer using a host language with variadic
(any number of arguments) functions can build a somewhat more powerful
kernel language and obviate macros for disjunction and conjunction.
Until now there was a large gap between those microKanren
implementations in languages with expressive macro systems and those
without; variadic functions permit an intermediate point in the
language design space. Even implementers in languages \emph{with}
macro systems might choose to replace existing less powerful language
primitives by our comparatively short but more powerful variants.
Beyond that, this more powerful kernel language obviates several
macros in the desugaring layer, and eventually leads us to see merit
in modifying the core language's syntax. This is, of course,
subjective.

Beyond being a conceptually simpler foundation for a full Kanren
language at the level of \citetitle{friedman2018reasoned}, this
implementation appears to be more \emph{efficient}. Right-associative
conjunction is already conjectured in miniKanren implementation
folklore to be an inefficient design choice. We were pleasantly
surprised that thinking about the expressivity of primitives and code
improvement \enquote{horse sense} led us to the same improved design.

In \cref{sec:all-aboard}, we briefly revisit microKanren
implementations and illustrate why surface syntax macros had seemed
practically mandatory. In~\cref{sec:conde}, we implement conjunction
and disjunction, and in \cref{sec:impure} we discuss the
re-implementation of the impure operators. We close with a discussion
of some performance impacts of these implementation choices, and
consider how Kanren language implementers outside of the Scheme family
might benefit from these alternatives.

\section{All Aboard!}\label{sec:all-aboard}

We assume the reader is familiar with the miniKanren language as
described in \citetitle{friedman2018reasoned} and in particular with
microKanren implementations. See \href{minikanren.org}{minikanren.org}
for many implementations across multiple host languages.

The world's shortest subway system is Haifa's Carmelit, with only
six stations. The system is a line, so its trains travel back and
forth. If we wanted to describe the order in which we rode the train
from the beginning to the end, we could use the
\rackinline|carmelit-subway| relation in~\cref{mnt:carmelit}. We
express this relation using the more compact miniKanren syntax because
unfolding this relation into binary conjunctions and disjunctions
would be painful. We certainly \emph{could} write it out by hand---in
fact, we could write it out many ways. We could nest those
conjunctions to the left, or to the right, or try and reduce the
indentation by trying to keep them somewhat balanced: the program
itself does not seem to obviously encourage one particular choice.

\end{listing}

\Cref{mnt:conj-and-disj-implementation} shows typical macro-based
implementations of \rackinline|conde| and the underlying conjunction
and disjunction operations. Here, \rackinline|#s| and \rackinline|#u|
represent primitive goals that unconditionally succeed and fail,
respectively.

\section{\rackinline|disj| and \rackinline|conj| logical goal
  constructors}\label{sec:conde}

The \rackinline|conj| and \rackinline|disj| macros of
~\cref{mnt:conj-and-disj-implementation} are not \emph{quite} defined
as simple recursions over their binary functional primitives. The
definition of zero-way conjunction (disjunction) is independent of the
unfolding of \rackinline|conj₂| (\rackinline|disj₂|). In a sense the
\rackinline|disj| and \rackinline|conj| macros confuse and entangle
primitive success and failure goals with those recursive unfoldings in
terms of the binary operators.

Those zero-way logical operation base cases don't add much. The
programmer who tries to write an elegant, efficient solution to a pure
relational programming task would not encounter these additional base
cases in \rackinline|conde| expressions. The programmer knows
statically how such goals should behave, so there is no benefit to
executing them. A conjunction of no goals would simply succeed, and a
disjunction of no goals would simply fail. Truthfully, only the impure
\rackinline|conda| operator seems to require these additional base
cases (discussed further in~\cref{sec:impure}). They are for all
intents and purposes superfluous.

Here, we want to implement disjunction and conjunction over
one-or-more goals as functions. These implementations will rely on
variadic function syntax, but should not require \rackinline|apply| or
rely on the binary \rackinline|disj₂| and \rackinline|conj₂|. Further,
they should not build any extraneous closures: unnecessarily building
closures at runtime is always a bad idea.

\begin{listing}

  (define (D s∞ gs s)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) s∞)
      (else
       (append∞ s∞
         (D ((car gs) s) (cdr gs) s)))))
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Re-implementation of \rackinline|disj|.}

    (C gs (g s)))

  (define (C gs s∞)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) s∞)
      (else
       (C (cdr gs)
          (append-map∞ (car gs) s∞)))))
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Re-implementation of \rackinline|conj|.}
  \label{mnt:conj-reimplementation}
\end{listing}

\Cref{mnt:disj-reimplementation,mnt:conj-reimplementation} show our
new implementations. Mandating one-or-more arguments lets us
re-implement these operators as shallow wrappers over simple folds.
The first step in each is merely to remove the rest argument
\rackinline|gs| and act as if there were no need for a rest argument.
That is, all of our focus will be on the \emph{list}, \rackinline|gs|.
Unlike \rackinline|D|, the function \rackinline|C| does not take in
the state \rackinline|s|; the help procedure does not need the state
for conjunction. In each recursive call, we accumulate by mapping
(using the special delaying implementation of append-map for
miniKanren streams) the next goal in the list. This left-fold
implementation of conjunction therefore left-associates the conjuncts.

\subsection{Implementation correctness}

Equipped with variadic functions, a developer might discover these
definitions as follows. We start from the definition of the
\rackinline|disj| macro in \cref{mnt:disj-function-before-derivation}.
At the cost of an \rackinline|apply|, we can build the corresponding
explicitly recursive \rackinline|disj| function.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(define-syntax disj
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((disj g) g)
    ((disj g₀ g₁ g ...)
     (disj₂ g₀ (disj g₁ g ...)))))

(define (disj g . gs)
  (cond
    ((null? gs) g)
    (else (disj₂ g (apply disj gs)))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{Deriving \rackinline|disj| function from macro.}
  \label{mnt:disj-function-before-derivation}
\end{listing}

\noindent Since \rackinline|disj| produces and consumes goals, we can
η expand the definition in \cref{mnt:disj-function-before-derivation}
by a curried parameter \rackinline|s|. We then split \rackinline|disj|
into two mutually-recursive procedures, to build the variant in
\cref{mnt:disj-function-split}.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(define ((disj g . gs) s)
  (D g gs s))

(define (D g gs s)
  (cond
    ((null? gs) (g s))
    (else ((disj₂ g (apply disj gs)) s))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{An η expanded and split definition of \rackinline|disj|.}
  \label{mnt:disj-function-split}
\end{listing}

\noindent We can replace the call to \rackinline|disj₂| in
\cref{mnt:disj-function-split} by its definition in terms of
\rackinline|append∞| and perform a trivial β-reduction. The explicit
\rackinline|s| argument suggests removing the call to
\rackinline|apply| and making \rackinline|D| recursive. The result is
the version of \rackinline|D| in \cref{mnt:disj-substituted-through}.
The definition of \rackinline|disj| in remains unchanged from
\cref{mnt:disj-function-split}.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(define (D g gs s)
  (cond
    ((null? gs) (g s))
    (else
      (append∞ (g s)
        (D (car gs) (cdr gs) s)))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{Derivation of \rackinline|disj| function definition.}
  \label{mnt:disj-substituted-through}
\end{listing}

\noindent We combine \rackinline|g| and \rackinline|s| in each clause;
this suggests constructing that stream in \rackinline|disj| and
passing it along. Making this final change results in the definition
in~\cref{mnt:disj-reimplementation}.


\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(define-syntax conj
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((conj g) g)
    ((conj g g₁ gs ...)
     (conj (conj₂ g g₁) gs ...))))

(define (conj g . gs)
  (cond
    ((null? gs) g)
    (else
     (apply conj
       (cons (conj₂ g (car gs)) (cdr gs))))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{\rackinline|conj₂|-based \rackinline|conj| function and macro.}
  \label{mnt:conj-function-derived-definition}
\end{listing}

We can derive the definition of \rackinline|conj| from
\cref{mnt:conj-reimplementation} via a similar process. Starting with
the variadic function based on the macro in
~\cref{mnt:conj-function-derived-definition}, we first η-expand and
split the definition.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
  (define ((conj g . gs) s)
    (C g gs s))

  (define (C g gs s)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) (g s))
      (else
       ((apply conj
          (cons (conj₂ g (car gs)) (cdr gs)))
        s))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{Derivation of split \rackinline|conj| function definition.}
  \label{mnt:conj-substituted-through}
\end{listing}
\noindent We next substitute for the definitions of \rackinline|conj| and
\rackinline|conj₂|.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
  (define (C g gs s)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) (g s))
      (else
       (C (λ (s) (append-map∞ (car gs) (g s)))
          (cdr gs)
          s))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{Replacing \rackinline|apply| in \rackinline|C| function definition.}
  \label{mnt:C-substituted-through}
\end{listing}

Finally, since \rackinline|C| only needs \rackinline|s| to
\emph{build} the stream, we can assemble the stream on the way
in---instead of passing in \rackinline|g| and \rackinline|s|
separately, we pass in their combination as a stream. The function is
tail recursive, we can change the signature in the one and only
external call and the recursive call. We show the result
in~\cref{mnt:conj-reimplementation}.

Both the variadic function based and the macro based versions of
\cref{mnt:conj-function-derived-definition} use a left fold over the
goals, whereas the versions of \rackinline|disj| use a right fold.
This is not an accident. It is miniKanren folklore that left
associating conjunctions tends to improve miniKanren performance. A
full, thorough, explanation of everything known about this behavior is
outside the scope of our work here, but see discussions by Rosenblatt
and Ballantyne. The matter seems so significant that the community
might consider reclassifying left-associative conjunction as a matter
of correctness rather than an optimization, as in \enquote{tail call
  optimization} vs. \enquote{Properly Implemented Tail Call
  Handling}~\cite{felleisen2014requestions}. However, we have
generally resorted to small step visualizations of the search tree to
demonstrate why that might be. The authors believe it is worth
considering if we can make an equally compelling argument for this
preference through equational reasoning.
\Cref{mnt:conj-right-fold-definition} shows a right-fold variant of
\rackinline|conj|. The choice to fold left becomes a little more
obvious after we η-expand, unfold to a recursive help function,
substitute in the definition of \rackinline|conj₂|, and β-reduce.

\begin{listing}[h]
\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
  (define (conj g . gs)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) g)
      (else (conj₂ g (apply conj gs)))))
\end{minted}
  \caption{A right-fold variant of \rackinline|conj|.}
  \label{mnt:conj-right-fold-definition}
\end{listing}

\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
  (define ((conj g . gs) s)
    (C gs (g s)))

  (define (C g gs s)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) (g s))
      (else (append-map-∞ (apply C gs) (g s)))))
\end{minted}

\noindent Here, we cannot (easily) replace the \rackinline|apply| call
by a recursive call to \rackinline|C|, because we are still waiting
for an \rackinline|s|. We can only abstract over \rackinline|s| and
wait.

\begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
  (define (C gs s∞)
    (cond
      ((null? gs) s∞)
      (else
       (append-map∞
         (λ (s) (C (cdr gs) ((car gs) s)))
         s∞))))
\end{minted}

Since we know that any call to \rackinline|append-map∞| we construct
will always yield a result, the version in
\cref{mnt:conj-reimplementation} is tail recursive. The equivalent
right-fold implementation needs to construct a closure for every
recursive call. If we want to implement a variadic version that does
not rely on a primitive \rackinline|conj2| and does not resort to
\rackinline|apply|, we have the two aformentioned choices. Basic
programming horse sense suggests the variant from
\cref{mnt:conj-reimplementation}.

Though this note mainly concerns the choice to implement surface
language behavior as functions, it may also point to these as more
natural user-level primitives than \rackinline|conde|. An
implementation could choose to forego \rackinline|conde| and provide
just those underlying logical primitives \rackinline|conj| and
\rackinline|disj| to the user, as in the new definition of Carmelit in
\cref{mnt:new-carmelit}.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(defrel (carmelit-subway a b c d e f)
  (disj
   (conj (== a 'carmel-center)
         (== b 'golomb)
         (== c 'masada)
         (== d 'haneviim)
         (== e 'hadar-city-hall)
         (== f 'downtown))
   (conj (== a 'downtown)
         (== b 'hadar-city-hall)
         (== c 'haneviim)
         (== d 'masada)
         (== e 'golomb)
         (== f 'carmel-center))))
  \end{minted}
  \caption{A new Carmelit subway without \rackinline|conde|.}

\section{Cleaning up the Impure Operators}\label{sec:impure}

The operators \rackinline|conda| and \rackinline|conde| look
superficially similar, syntactically. Semantically though,
\rackinline|conda|'s nested \enquote{if-then-else} behavior is quite
different, and implementing the desired behavior for this
\rackinline|conda| from existing pieces points to some oddities. The
definition of \rackinline|conda| (see \cref{mnt:conda-implementation})
rules out zero-way conjunctions of goals in the clause body as well as
zero-way disjunctions of such clauses. A \rackinline|conda| that
permits one-or-more-goals in each clause is the one and only place in
the whole language implementation that may require a nullary
conjunction of goals. So this soft-cut operator seems to force both
nullary conjunction and those primitive goals \rackinline|#s| and
\rackinline|#u| into the language.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(define-syntax conda
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((conda (g₀ g ...)) (conj g₀ g ...))
    ((conda (g₀ g ...) ln ...)
     (ifte g₀ (conj g ...) (conda ln ...)))))

(define ((ifte g₁ g₂ g₃) s)
  (let loop ((s∞ (g₁ s)))
    (cond
      ((null? s∞) (g₃ s))
      ((pair? s∞)
       (append-map g₂ s∞))
      (else (lambda ()
              (loop (s∞)))))))
  \end{minted}
  \caption{A typical implementation of \rackinline|conda|.}
  \label{mnt:conda-implementation}
\end{listing}

Some programmers would be perfectly satisfied just using
\rackinline|ifte| directly. But just as the standard forked
\rackinline|if| begat McCarthy's \rackinline|if| notation and
\rackinline|cond|, we can suspect that a programmer would eventually
feel the need for a nested implementation. There are other alternative
implementation choices one could consider.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Syntactically mandate that all clauses in \rackinline|conda|
  contain at least two goals.

\item Syntactically mandate that all clauses \emph{except the final
    default clause} contain at least two goals.

\item Introduce a special clause of the \rackinline|conda| macro
  specifically for \enquote{if then} clauses with a single goal.

\item Unconditionally add an a \rackinline|#s| goal to each clause
  during macro expansion.

\end{enumerate}

Each of these choices can, implicitly or explicitly, force additional
unneeded executions of unwanted goals. Here too, removing macros and
relying on variable arity function definition provides a more elegant
solution.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{minted}[autogobble,stripall]{racket}
(define ((conda q a . q-and-a*) s)
  (A (q s) a q-and-a* s))

(define (A s∞ a q-and-a* s)
  (cond
    ((null? s∞)
     (cond
       ((null? (cdr q-and-a*)) ((car q-and-a*) s))
       (else (A ((car q-and-a*) s)
                    (cadr q-and-a*)
                    (cddr q-and-a*) s))))
    ((pair? s∞) (append-map∞ a s∞))
    (else (lambda () (A (s∞) a q-and-a* s)))))
  \end{minted}
  \caption{A functional \rackinline|conda| implementation.}
  \label{mnt:conda-good-re-implementation}
\end{listing}

The implementation in~\cref{mnt:conda-good-re-implementation} includes
the delay-and-restart behavior of \rackinline|ifte| together with
\rackinline|conda|'s logical cascade.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This note shows that at the cost of one additional feature---namely
variadic functions---implementers provide a somewhat more powerful
core language and significantly reduce the need for macros in
implementing a language as expressive as the full
\verb|microKanren + Macros| approach provides. Our desugaring macros
would have worked whether we left or right associated. Removing a
degree of freedom in the implementation, and forcing ourselves to
program the solution functionally, led us to what seems like the right
solution.

The result is closer to the design of Prolog, where the user
represents conjuction of goals in the body of a clause with a comma
and disjunction, either implicitly in listing various clauses or
explicitly with a semicolon.

We take it as granted that disjunction and conjunction themselves are
sufficiently high-level operators for a surface language and that the
0-element base cases are at best unnecessary and likely undesireable;
given the opportunity to define a surface language and its desugaring,
we really shouldn't tempt the programmer by making undesireable
programs representable when we can avoid doing so.

We take advantage of the fact that our syntax can ensure an
adequate number of arguments. Languages with variadic but without
polyvariadic (that is to say \enquote{at least $k$ arguments})
functions may not see that benefit.

We have not completely obviated the use of macros. We still implement
\rackinline|defrel| and \rackinline|fresh| with macros, the former to
prevent exposing the implementation of streams and delays, and the
latter both for the added efficiency and to avoid the awkwardness of
introducing each variable one at a time. Languages without expressive
macro systems still have to resort to exposing implementations of
streams and lower level operations like introducing
variables one at a time.

From time to time we find that the usual miniKanren implementation is
itself lower-level than we would like to program with relations. Early
microKanren implementations restrict themselves to
\rackinline|syntax-rules| macros. Several more powerful syntax
constructions over miniKanren may rely on more expressive macro
systems, including Ballantyne's
\rackinline|minikanren-ee|~\cite{ballantyne2020macros}. Expert
miniKanren programmers use macros to extend the language further. as
with \rackinline|matche|~\cite{keep2009pattern}, and also with wholly
more expressive and highly optimized language forms, as in the
original \rackinline|Kanren|.

More languages than ever before support variable arity
functions/methods (aka \verb|varargs| aka \verb|slurpy| methods),
including JavaScript, Raku, Java, and Ruby, to name just a few. Many
of these languages also support polyvariadic functions. We hope this
document helps narrow the gap between implementations in functional
host languages with and without macro systems and helps implementers
build more elegant, expressive and efficient Kanrens in their chosen
host languages.
